     ```

## Step 3: Run the Automated Downloader

The script now automatically:
1. üì• Downloads PDFs from Gmail
2. üóÇÔ∏è Organizes them into year/month folders
3. üíæ Imports jobs to the database

```bash
# Download, organize, and import all run sheets from January 1st, 2025
python3 scripts/download_runsheets_gmail.py

# Or specify a custom date (format: YYYY/MM/DD)
python3 scripts/download_runsheets_gmail.py 2025/10/01
```

**First Run:**
- A browser window will open
- Sign in with your Gmail account
- Click "Allow" to grant access
- The script will save a `token.json` file for future runs

**What It Does:**
1. Connects to Gmail and searches for run sheet emails
2. Downloads PDF attachments to `RunSheets/` folder
3. Extracts the date from each PDF
4. Moves PDFs to `RunSheets/YYYY/MM/` folders
5. Imports all jobs to the database automatically
6. Shows summary of downloaded and imported jobs

## Manual Import (Optional)

If you want to import run sheets manually:

```bash
python3 scripts/import_run_sheets.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### "credentials.json not found"
- Make sure you downloaded the OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
- Rename it to `credentials.json`
- Place it in the Wages-App directory

### "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"
- Make sure you configured the OAuth consent screen
- Add your email as a test user in the OAuth consent screen settings

### No emails found
- Check the search query in the script matches your email subject lines
- Try adjusting the `query` variable in `search_run_sheet_emails()`
- Common patterns:
  - `subject:"run sheet"`
  - `subject:"RUN SHEETS"`
  - `from:sender@example.com has:attachment filename:pdf`

## Customizing the Search

Edit `scripts/download_runsheets_gmail.py` line ~60 to customize the search:

```python
query = f'has:attachment filename:pdf subject:"run sheet" after:{after_date}'
```

You can add:
- `from:specific@email.com` - Only from specific sender
- `subject:"exact subject"` - Specific subject line
- `filename:"RUN SHEETS"` - Specific filename pattern

## Security Notes

- `credentials.json` - Your OAuth app credentials (keep private)
- `token.json` - Your access token (keep private, auto-generated)
- Both files are gitignored by default
- Never commit these files to version control
